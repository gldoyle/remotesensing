## Module 1:

To begin to appreciate the world beyond the visible light spectrum, we will look at how false color composites can highlight or enhance trends that natural color composites can't capture.

This tutorial is based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts which are suitable for learning remote sensing concepts due to the fact that the platform is open-sourced meaning anyone can access these tools and also because through interaction with these tools, those interested can gain practice in using different spectral bands to visualize the world in new ways.

First, let's look at how we can identify burn scars in landscapes after wildfires. Satellite imagery is often used to track wildfires as they happen, evaluate the extent of the damage in the aftermath of the disaster, and to predict which areas are more susceptible to future wildfires.

In this first tutorial we'll look at Australia after the 2020 bushfires. By interacting
with this GEE script, you'll be able to see what burn scars look like in satellite imagery (in this case, the MODIS dataset)

Below is a link which will take you to Google Earth Engine where you will be able to access the burn scar interactive tool.

By running the script you will see a map with layers that can be turned on
