# Remote Sensing Educational Tutorials

In this repository you will find educational tools to help students with some background knowledge in the Electromagnetic Spectrum, but who are unfamiliar with remote
sensing, gain familiarity with remote sensing without having to have any sort of GIS or coding background. All the scripts were written in Google Earth Engine
which a useful open source platform meaning those are interested can learn to create their own scripts to visualize different environmental phenomena across space and time.
