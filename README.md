# Literature Review on Effective Teaching in Remote Sensing and Spectral Analysis 

### Eye Learn: An interactive WEB based e-Learning Environment in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing
https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.72.8336&rep=rep1&type=pdf

* Problems in the field of remote sensing education online courses and exercises exist for RS and photogrammetry but have poor structure, are very static and are either targeted for high-level students or are very broad
* The RS units are thematic modules, some of them taught by specialists –. Meaning students have to adapt to different teaching methods
* Objective: “More capabilities for doing practical work and learning-by-doing by providing simple easy-to-use programs and test data, possibility to do practical work alone (and learn more) and repeat it if needed, thus increasing the knowledge acquired but also the student motivation and making clearer the practical relevance of the learned methods.”
* Choice freedom: increasing motivation and interest by allowing students in terms of use of the images and application of interest
Target audience: students in Bachelor in Geomatics Engineering and Planning and students from other departments
* “Emphasis will be given to the understanding of theory through own problem solving oriented work. Evaluation and self-evaluation procedures will allow better control of what is learnt and how well and will allow a refinement of the e-Learning environment.” 


### The Making of a Joint E-Learning Platform for Remote Sensing Education: Experiences and Lessons Learned

https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/9/1718/htm

* 20 modules where the first half focuses on building the basis for application of Remote Sensing where the second half focuses on providing
different ways of mapping and supporting the specific situation
* Text format with imagery, audio and video material embedded into modules
* Quiz tool at the end which was implemented for self-assessment at the final stage of the module
* Difficulty: processing techniques and methods are tailored to specific local environmental phenomena, adnt hus are not readily adaptable to other geographic locations
* Relied on open source software (QGIS, Snap and R)

### ESRI tools ---> Learn ArcGIS: Get started with multidimensional multispectral imagery

* “Use a multidimensional stack of Landsat imagery to visualize how a Chilean copper mine has changed over time.”
* Learn how to enhance spectral information
* Not super interactive –> follow written instructions on a page to download data etc into ArcGIS pro 
* Other modules include: explore dynamic imagery of volcanic eruption (smoke-penetrating SWIR band combo), assess burn scars with satellite imagery (calculate a burn index using imagery bands to measure fires in Montana), Calculate impervious surfaces from spectral imagery (through classification), assess hail damage in cornfields with satellite imagery

### Smith et al: Design of a module for teaching/learning spectral analysis

https://peer.asee.org/design-of-a-module-for-teaching-learning-spectral-analysis

* Focused primarily on biomedical applications
* Encourages constructive use of the interactive demonstration

## TEXTBOOKS

#### Fundamentals of Remote Sensing and Airphoto Interpretation
* Goes into the details of photogrammetry 
* Ex: computing heights using object displacement 
* Acquisition of Aerial Photographs
** Pg 114: physics of multispectral scanners
* Landsat Orbital Characteristics
** Also describes the different uses for Landsat bands! Will be helpful (pg 142)
* NOAA bands and uses
** Could be useful if this is data accessible via GEE
* Radar, SAR
* Species Identification Characteristics

#### Remote Sensing of the Environment
* Chapter on Remote Sensing of Water
* Chapter on Remote Sensing of Vegetation
* These are a bit more technical than I would like to go in my lessons

#### Remote Sensing and Image Processing
* Interesting chapter on graphical representation of the spectral response pattern
** Would be useful if going into details about classification (pg 599)
* Unsupervised and supervised classification

#### Remote Sensing: Principles and Interpretation
* Spectral Reflectance (pg. 47)
* Briefly touches upon characteristics of the eye and vision which is interesting
* Extensive chapter on Landsat imagery and geological applications of remote sensing across a variety of geographic locations (e.g. fault lines)
