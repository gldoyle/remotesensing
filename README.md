Problems in the field of remote sensing education online courses and exercises exist for RS and photogrammetry but have poor structure, are very static and are either targeted for high-level students or are very broad

The RS units are thematic modules, some of them taught by specialists –. Meaning students have to adapt to different teaching methods

Objective: “More capabilities for doing practical work and learning-by-doing by providing simple easy-to-use programs and test data, possibility to do practical work alone (and learn more) and repeat it if needed, thus increasing the knowledge acquired but also the student motivation and making clearer the practical relevance of the learned methods.”

Choice freedom: increasing motivation and interest by allowing students in terms of use of the images and application of interest
Target audience: students in Bachelor in Geomatics Engineering and Planning and students from other departments

“Emphasis will be given to the understanding of theory through own problem solving oriented work. Evaluation and self-evaluation procedures will allow better control of what is learnt and how well and will allow a refinement of the e-Learning environment.”
